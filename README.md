# SDCBench

# TODOs

### Update runner tool with silifuzz
* Add way to update corpus on client

### Find binaries to look for SDC instructions
* Compile distributed binaries, disassemble instructions and look for similar mnemonic?

### Figure out how to customize silifuzz
* Influence the mutator to generate variants of say -- lock instructions?
